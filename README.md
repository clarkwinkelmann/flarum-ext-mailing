Send individual or mass mailing to Flarum users.

## Installation

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-mailing

Pre-beta 14 the package was called `kilowhat/flarum-ext-mailing`.

## Documentation

The individual user mailing button can be found in the user card dropdown menu, including the user profile page and while hovering a username in a discussion.

The mass mailing button can be found in the session dropdown menu under the link to the admin panel.

If the FriendOfFlarum User Directory extension is enabled, the buttons for both features can be found on that page as well.

Two permissions allow you to select which groups can send individual emails and emails to all users.

**Send emails to individual users**: allows to select one or multiple Flarum users. Also allows to enter email addresses not connected to any user

**Send emails to groups or all users**: allows to select groups, including "Members" to send to all registered users.

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
